		This year, on my birthday, my parents made a banner which read my name as an acronym for some nice adjectives.<br> I liked it, so now I made a website doing the same thing. This website can also be used to give compliments and content for birthday cards.<br>This website was made possible by my family and friends who helped with compiling the list of adjectives and refining the code.
